# Overview

My software displays "Hello World!" to the screen, as well as the current date, and a positive message. This project serves as an introduction to this repository, and as such it will serve as the most basic of the projects here. 

Due to this, I decided to add a positive message for anyone who decided to run it themselves. I hope you have a great day.
